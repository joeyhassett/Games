# Games
I am newer to Github and wanted to try coding a couple applications and games I had thought of that I eventually want to bring over to mobile. One of them is an app that allows for queues to be built across multiple streaming services to accomodate people running a collaborative aux. Hopefully, this will work cross-platform with Spotify, Pandora, etc
